# Ray Tracing Engine
Raytracing engine with help from the series [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley.  
Built and rendered in Java, this ray tracing engine renders physically accurate light, shadows, and reflections.  
This project is still in progress.  
I would still like to add custom light sources, fog, texture mapping, motion blur and much more.  

## Interactive Raytracer Demo:

The interactive raytracer allows the user to move around and view the scene from different angles. I have yet to implement GPU acceleration so the rendering quality is significantly hindered. Generating the higher quality images below takes around 20 seconds per frame.
