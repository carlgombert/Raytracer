# Ray Tracing Engine
Raytracing engine with help from the series [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley.  
Built and rendered in Java, this ray tracing engine renders physically accurate light, shadows, and reflections.  
This project is still in progress.  
My main goal with this project is to process and load in 3D objects from OBJ files. I just need to implement polygon rendering before I can do this.  
I would also like to add custom light sources, fog, texture mapping, motion blur and much more.  

## Interactive Raytracer Demo:

The interactive raytracer allows the user to move around and view the scene from different angles. I haven't implemented GPU acceleration so the rendering speed isn't great. Generating the higher quality images below takes around 20 seconds per frame. The interactive mode allows the user to enter C and take high quality captures of the current display as they move around.
